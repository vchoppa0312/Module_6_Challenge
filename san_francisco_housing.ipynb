    "# Housing Rental Analysis for San Francisco\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, your job is to use your data visualisation skills, including aggregation, interactive visualisations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `san_francisco_housing.ipynb` notebook to visualise and analyse the real-estate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this assignment requires you to create a visualisation by using hvPlot and GeoViews. Additionally, you need to read the `sfo_neighborhoods_census_data.csv` file from the `Resources` folder into the notebook and create the DataFrame that you’ll use in the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main task in this Challenge is to visualise and analyse the real-estate data in your Jupyter notebook. Use the `san_francisco_housing.ipynb` notebook to complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate and plot the housing units per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate and plot the average prices per square foot.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compare the average prices by neighbourhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build an interactive neighbourhood map.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compose your data story.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculate and Plot the Housing Units per Year\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part of the assignment, use numerical and visual aggregation to calculate the number of housing units per year, and then visualise the results as a bar chart. To do so, complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the `groupby` function to group the data by year. Aggregate the results by the `mean` of the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the `hvplot` function to plot the `housing_units_by_year` DataFrame as a bar chart. Make the x-axis represent the `year` and the y-axis represent the `housing_units`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Style and format the line plot to ensure a professionally styled visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Note that your resulting plot should appear similar to the following image:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![A screenshot depicts an example of the resulting bar chart.](Images/6-4-zoomed-housing-units-by-year.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * What’s the overall trend in housing units over the period that you’re analysing?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculate and Plot the Average Sale Prices per Square Foot\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part of the assignment, use numerical and visual aggregation to calculate the average prices per square foot, and then visualise the results as a bar chart. To do so, complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Group the data by year, and then average the results. What’s the lowest gross rent that’s reported for the years that the DataFrame includes?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a new DataFrame named `prices_square_foot_by_year` by filtering out the “housing_units” column. The new DataFrame should include the averages per year for only the sale price per square foot and the gross rent.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use hvPlot to plot the `prices_square_foot_by_year` DataFrame as a line plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > **Hint** This single plot will include lines for both `sale_price_sqr_foot` and `gross_rent`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Style and format the line plot to ensure a professionally styled visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Note that your resulting plot should appear similar to the following image:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![A screenshot depicts an example of the resulting plot.](Images/6-4-avg-sale-px-sq-foot-gross-rent.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use both the `prices_square_foot_by_year` DataFrame and interactive plots to answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Did any year experience a drop in the average sale price per square foot compared to the previous year?\n",
    "\n",
    "    * If so, did the gross rent increase or decrease during that year?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compare the Average Sale Prices by Neighbourhood\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part of the assignment, use interactive visualisations and widgets to explore the average sale price per square foot by neighbourhood. To do so, complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new DataFrame that groups the original DataFrame by year and neighbourhood. Aggregate the results by the `mean` of the groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Filter out the “housing_units” column to create a DataFrame that includes only the `sale_price_sqr_foot` and `gross_rent` averages per year.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Create an interactive line plot with hvPlot that visualises both `sale_price_sqr_foot` and `gross_rent`. Set the x-axis parameter to the year (`x=\"year\"`). Use the `groupby` parameter to create an interactive widget for `neighbourhood`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Style and format the line plot to ensure a professionally styled visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Note that your resulting plot should appear similar to the following image:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![A screenshot depicts an example of the resulting plot.](Images/6-4-pricing-info-by-neighborhood.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use the interactive visualisation to answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * For the Anza Vista neighbourhood, is the average sale price per square foot for 2016 more or less than the price that’s listed for 2012?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Build an Interactive Neighbourhood Map\n",
    "\n",
    "For this part of the assignment, explore the geospatial relationships in the data by using interactive visualisations with hvPlot and GeoViews. To build your map, use the `sfo_data_df` DataFrame (created during the initial import), which includes the neighbourhood location data with the average prices. To do all this, complete the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the `neighbourhood_coordinates.csv` file from the `Resources` folder into the notebook, and create a DataFrame named `neighbourhood_locations_df`. Be sure to set the `index_col` of the DataFrame as “Neighbourhood”.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the original `sfo_data_df` Dataframe, create a DataFrame named `all_neighbourhood_info_df` that groups the data by neighbourhood. Aggregate the results by the `mean` of the group.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Review the two code cells that concatenate the `neighbourhood_locations_df` DataFrame with the `all_neighbourhood_info_df` DataFrame. Note that the first cell uses the [Pandas concat function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.concat.html) to create a DataFrame named `all_neighbourhoods_df`. The second cell cleans the data and sets the “Neighbourhood” column. Be sure to run these cells to create the `all_neighbourhoods_df` DataFrame, which you’ll need to create the geospatial visualisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using hvPlot with GeoViews enabled, create a `points` plot for the `all_neighbourhoods_df` DataFrame. Be sure to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Set the `size` parameter to “sale_price_sqr_foot”.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Set the `color` parameter to “gross_rent”.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Set the `frame_width` parameter to 700.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Set the `frame_height` parameter to 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Include a descriptive title.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that your resulting plot should appear similar to the following image:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ![A screenshot depicts an example of a scatter plot created with hvPlot and GeoViews.](Images/6-4-geoviews-plot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use the interactive map to answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Which neighbourhood has the highest gross rent, and which has the highest sale price per square foot?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compose Your Data Story\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the visualisations that you created, answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How does the trend in rental income growth compare to the trend in sales prices? Does this same trend hold true for all the neighbourhoods across San Francisco?\n",
    "\n",
    "* What insights can you share with your company about the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they're pursuing? Do neighbourhoods exist that you would suggest for investment, and why?"

To build your map, use the `sfo_data_df` DataFrame (created during the initial import), which includes the neighbourhood location data with the average prices. To do all this, complete the following steps:\n",

The second cell cleans the data and sets the “Neighbourhood” column. Be sure to run these cells to create the `all_neighbourhoods_df` DataFrame, which you’ll need to create the geospatial visualisation.\n",

    "**Answer:** Going by the trends witnessed, the company could potentially benefit from the one-click, buy-and-rent strategy. With rental income showing positive and continuos growth over the years across the neighbourhoods, there is a clear case for growing return on investment except a few neighbourhoods like Anza Vista where the decreasing trend of sales price might negate the potential return from growing rental income.\n",

For example, neighbourhoods like Buena Vista Park, Central Sunset, Cow Hollow, Downtown, Sunnyside, Glen Park, Outer Richmond, Yerba Buena and Ashbury Heights could provide a double upside of growing rental income and growth in asset prices(sales price) going by a developing trend of growth in sales prices in these neighbourhoods in recent years.
